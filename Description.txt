Hello, it's Jad Mattar. This is a description file of the project.

In this file, we are going to build an AI agent that solves the sudoku using csp and backtracking.
The Sudoku is defined as an array of 9 blocks as shown in the image "indices_clarification.jpg" labeled by a thick black border, containg the numbers from 1 to 9. Each block (for example the top left one) is a 2D array consisting of 3 rows and 3 columns. 
This 3D array is the input of the system.
Each empty cell is -1 and the numbered cell is represented by the number itself.

Main Rule:
Each row, column and block (9 spaces each) needs to be filled out with the numbers from 1 to 9, without repeating any numbers within the row, column or square.

The solution should be returned based on the rule indicated above, no matter whether the sudoku is in easy or medium or hard mode.
